# Shima

Shima is a decentralized application that enables users to become blockchain RPC providers and get paid for their contributions. By distributing requests across multiple providers based on their performance, Shima ensures a smooth and optimal user experience while promoting decentralization.

## Features

- Decentralized network of blockchain RPC providers
- Load balancing across multiple RPC providers
- Automated provider selection based on performance
- Secure handling of user API keys
- Payments handling for users and RPC providers

## Goal

Shima's goal is to decentralize the usage of blockchain RPCs by allowing anyone to become an RPC provider and get paid for their service. This approach aims to distribute the responsibility of maintaining and providing RPC services across a larger network of individuals, thereby improving the overall stability and accessibility of the blockchain infrastructure. By incentivizing users to become providers, Shima aims to create a more robust and resilient system for accessing blockchain data and services.
